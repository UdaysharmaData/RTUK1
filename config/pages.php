					[
					'question' => 'What An Achilles Rupture/Partial Rupture?',
					'answer' => "<div><p>The Achilles Tendon is one of the most commonly injured structures in the human body. This is most likely due to the active lifestyle we now lead and the amount of time we spend on our feet.</p><p>The Achilles is the largest tendon in the body and connects your gastrocnemius/Soleus (Calve muscles) to your heel bone.</p><p>A complete Achilles Rupture involves the tendon completing snapping. Often you will hear a snap or popping sound. A partial tear will cause some soreness but you will still have full use of the ankle.</p></div>",
					'media' => ['difference.png'],
					],
					[
					'question' => 'How will I know the difference?',
					'answer' => "<div><p>A full Achilles rupture will result in complete loss of strength and function of the ankle. You will find it extremely difficult to walk or complete any exercise. Normally at the time of the injury happening you will hear a large pop or snap sound. Often there will be a large amount of swelling around the ankle. In some cases the calve muscles will move up into a higher position behind the back of the knee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With a partial rupture there will be no popping/snapping sound and you will still have full function of the ankle. There will be some localised soreness around the Achilles tendon and it may also feel bruised. Some swelling may be present but this will slowly decrease.</p></div>",
					],
					[
					'question' => 'How do these injuries happen?',
					'answer' => "<div><p>With both a complete/partial rupture the mechanism of injury is very similar</p><ul><li>Quick sharp movement which puts too much stress through the ankle causing damage to the tendon. This could be turning quickly in a sport such as football or netball.</li><li>Large increase in training volume or intensity</li><li>A fall where you land awkwardly and put pressure onto the ankle</li><li>A weakened tendon due to old age or use of corticosteroid medication</li><li>Previous history of tendinosis</li><li>A direct trauma to the Achilles tendon</li></ul></div>",
					],
					[
					'question' => 'What treatments can be done for a partial rupture?',
					'answer' => "Initially you should be focussing on completely resting the ankle and regularly icing of the area around the tendon. After this gentle stretches of the calve muscles along with ankle mobilisations will help. We recommend the exercises below. If you find that after 4 weeks of rest the ankle is still sore and you are unable to exercise consult a sports injury specialist.",

					[
					'question' => 'Note',
					'answer' => "If you fear you have a complete rupture please consult your doctor immediately. They will initially send you for imaging to determine the extent of the damage. Once imaging has been completed normally either casting of the ankle or surgery will be required.",

					'question' => 'What is an ACL Rupture?',

					],
					[
					'question' => 'How does an ACL rupture happen?',
					'answer' => "<div><p>ACL tears often happen during sports that involve quick sharp movements. You will often hear a pop or large click sound. This sound is the ligament snapping.</p><p>The amount of pain experienced varies between individuals with some only experiencing slight pain &amp; others in agony. Normally all cases have large amounts of swelling around the knee which will restrict the amount of movement at the joint. You may also feel the knee is unstable &amp; weak.</p></div>",
					],
					[
					'question' => 'Who is at risk of an ACL rupture?',
					'answer' => "<div><ul><li><strong>Females</strong> have a higher risk of ACL injuries due to an increased Q angle. This is the angle between the hips – knee. Traditionally females have wider hips meaning a more acute angle and increased pressure on the knee.</li><li>People participating in football, American football, basketball and handball</li><li>A <strong>lack of strength training</strong> leading to weaknesses around the knee</li><li>People with <strong>incorrect footwear</strong> or footwear not suitable on a surface</li></ul></div>",
					],
					[
					'question' => 'What can I do to prevent ACL ruptures?',
					'answer' => "<div><p>It is proven that the correct strength training and exercise can help to minimise the risk of suffering an ACL injury. If you are playing sports with quick changes of directions it is recommended you complete regular strength training sessions. We would suggest you focus on:</p><ul><li>Hamstring and Glute strengthening</li><li>Core stability exercises</li><li>Exercises that focus on knee stabilisation.</li><li>Training to improve technique when landing from jumps and changing direction quickly.</li></ul></div>",
					],
					[
					'question' => 'What are the treatment options if I rupture my ACL?',
					'answer' => "<div><p>Normally with this severe injury surgery is required to correct the issue. The normal procedure is to take a graft from your hamstring and use this to repair the damaged ACL. Surgery has been shown to help reduce the risk of future osteoarthritis after ACL injuries.</p><p>Recent research is showing that ACL ruptures can heal naturally and the recent studies are promising. Eventually it is possible that ACL ruptures will not always require surgical action.</p><p>Normally with a complete rupture ACL injuries take <strong>6-12 months</strong> to fully recover. The healing time for individuals will always vary</p></div>",

					'question' => "How does an Ankle Sprain happen?",
					'answer' => "<div><p>Ankle sprains happen when the foot is awkwardly placed either on an unstable surface or upon landing.</p><p>The most common sprain occurs when you roll or twist the ankle. If you have a history of “rolling” the ankle then you are more likely to have the injury happen again. This is because when you damage the ligament you also damage its proprioceptors. These are specialised cells within the ligament which ensure the foot is placed in the correct position when walking or exercising. If they are damaged they do not complete this function correctly and you are more likely to place the foot incorrectly. &nbsp;</p><p>The research shows us if you have sprained the ankle you have a 40-70% higher chance of reinjuring the ankle.</p></div>",
					],
					[
					'question' => "What are the different type of Ankle Sprains?",
					'answer' => "<div><p>With all sprains there are 3 separate grades of injury.</p><p><strong>Grade 1 (Mild) –</strong> The ligament has been overstretched but still intact with no damage to the ligament itself. You may feel some localised soreness around the ankle.</p><p><strong>Grade 2 (Moderate) –</strong> The ligament has been overstretched with a partial tear in the ligament itself. You will experience moderate levels of pain, limping &amp; some localised bruising/swelling. You may also experience some instability in the ankle.</p><p><strong>Grade 3 (Severe) –</strong> The ligament has been overstretched and completely ruptures. You will often hear a pop or snap sound at the time of injury. You will experience; high levels of pain, severe swelling/bruising &amp; inability to put pressure on the ankle.</p></div>",
